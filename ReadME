* Using Java Script,Html and CSS i created Maze-Game-2, Its a fun 2D based game.
* The Goal of the game is to get the key (user) to the house through the maze.
* There are 4 levels of difficulty you can try Easy-Medium-Hard-Extreme.
* I also imported Key.png and Home.png with are images of a key (user) and a home (goal).
