* Using Java Script,Html and CSS i created Maze-Game-2, Its a fun 2D based game.

* The Goal of the game is to get the key (user) to the house through the maze.

* There are 4 levels of difficulty you can try Easy-Medium-Hard-Extreme.

* I also imported Key.png and Home.png which are images of a key (user) and a home (goal).

* I have also uploaded 4 Different images so you can see what the different levels look like.

*If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via Email.
